### Inspiration...
The project was started on the 24th of October, 2015. Being a **beginner** of C, I wanted to tune my skills and explore the limitless abilities of C. With little prior experience in C and some experience in Ruby, I aimed to duplicate a RPG I wrote entirely using [bash scripts](https://github.com/0x1p2/uo-shell).

### Installation:
```bash
# Git way of installation:
git clone https://github.com/0x1p2/rpg-c
cd rpg-c/
make
./rpg-c
```
```bash
#TAR installation.
tar zvxf 0x1p2-rpg-c*.tar.gz
cd 0x1p2-rpg*/
make
./rpg-c
```

#### Game Environment:
It's heavily influenced by Ultima Online. The **Stats**, **Skills**, and **Items** laid an excellent foundation for something that was obtainable but also a challenge. 

#### Features:
+ Single-Player (for now)
+ Combat
+ Modular
+ Linux Compatible (Windows support planned)
+ Locations to be explored!
+ Stat Gain
+ Item Purchase
+ Consumables

#### Extra Features:
|Items|Skills|Stats|
|---|---|---|
|Bandages|Archery|Dexterity|
|Gold|Magery|Wisdom|
||Fencing|Strength|
||Swordsmanship|Luck|
||Mace Fighting||
|__MAX__ =>|120.0|255|

#### Future Plans:
+ Windows Support
+ Multi-player (client/server)
+ More Skills 
  + Evaluating Intelligence
  + Focus
  + Meditation
  + Anatomy
  + Healing (Bandage effectiveness)
+ More Stats
  + Stamina Bar
  + Mana Bar
+ More items
  + Potions
  + Weapons
  + Armor
