Compiled using make in the the same directory as this README file.

  make :	compiles the entire program into "rpg-c". 
		"rpg-c" will be located in either bin/ or the parent directory.
  make clean :	removes all objs from installation.

 Directories:
 	bin/		: May contain the executable for the program.
	src/		: All .c source files.
	src/headers	: Headers for the .c source files.
	objs/		: Object files (.o) files from the compiling.
	bak/		: Store backups for headers and c source files.
	dev_test/	: A temporary directory for testing ideas.
	save/		: Stores player information.

;- Start of Change Log.
Change Log:
	09, NOV:
		+ Begin working on adding skills.
		+ Fixed a health mis-match on loading a profile. Also changed the name of the
		   load function to load_profile function. (making way for a load_config)
	08, NOV:
		+ Added possible stat gain of strength on bandages. Changed the hp formula
		   of how much strength influences hp.
		   + Small issue resolved where hp wasn't being updated in stage() and
		      round_start() *hp formula.
		+ "Randomized" dungeon room descriptions. (similar to how the rooms is done)
		+ Resolved "range" issue. Round was being skipped due to a newline being
		   being processed.
		+ Added the ability to view the changelog in game (only at the main menu)
		   A fancy viewing of the README fle using ';-' as a token.
	07, NOV:
		+ Added password hashing. Prompts and saves password hash with profile.
		   Not exactly the most "secure" implementation but it is a working example.
		+ You now have the ability to set the mob's type ([A]rcher, [M]age, [W]arrior.
		   This is an extension of being able to select the Mobs level. Eventually this 
		   will be randomized and determined by the location you are in.
	06, NOV:
		+ Main menu moved to "stage" (location.h)
		  + Bandaid use added to the staging area.
		  + Combat (Arena like-) added to the staging area
		  + Added stat view ability (added to stage)
		  + Created a quit (free's players struct and the nodes (locations))
		+ Little modifications to Combat (text display)
		+ Dungeon rooms added
		  + Names come from a list; DESCRIPTION TO BE DONE THE SAME WAY.
		+ Stage is a part of the "head" node (location), dungeon branches off from it.
	05, NOV:
		+ Resolved a bandage count (-3), wasn't being saved with profile and was
		   Pulling a random number.
		+ Prevented using more than you had of bandages. 
		+ Locations added (node_t struct in soul_create.h)
		+ Greeting menu added (non-location ATT)
		+ Changed humanoid_t to soul_t (Struct to create players and mobs)
	04, NOV:
		+ Save and loading added.
		+ Started working on locations.
	03, NOV:
		+ ADDED BANDAGES! Yes, a new way to heal.

	01, NOV:
		+ Added defense attribute to the player and Monster.
		+ Added a chance to block.
		+ Mob levels implemented. Merged the functions that create players and mobs.
	29-31OCT:
		+ Attempted to work in a Ring (Circular buffer) for the combat log. 
		   It is semi-working but needs to be designed better. Commented out and
		   left the struct along with the lines to start the buffer. To be revisted
		   At a later time.
	28, OCT:
		+ Added range to the combat. Now Mobs and Players have a range to them.
	27, OCT:
		+ Created menu's/HUDs for the combat to get a better idea what is happening.
		+ Split it into several files. Created headers and did cleaning.
		+ Create "Makefile" for easier compiling.
		+ Created "luck" to help change gold loot.
		+ Made strength reflect HP gain. ATT: 1str = 5hp.
	26, OCT:
		+ Creation of combat. Simple compution of predefined values.
		+ Begin working with formulas for damage (using a modulus and rand())
		+ Creation of simple "classes", Mage, Warrior, Archer,
		+ Introduction of sub struct for said classes.
	25, OCT:
		+ Introduction of functions for character creation and mob creation.
	24, OCT:
