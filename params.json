{"name":"RPG-C","tagline":"Text-Based RPG written entirely in C -from scratch!","body":"### Inspiration...\r\nThe project was started on the 24th of October, 2015. Being a **beginner** of C, I wanted to tune my skills and explore the limitless abilities of C. With little prior experience in C and some experience in Ruby, I aimed to duplicate a RPG I wrote entirely using [bash scripts](https://github.com/0x1p2/uo-shell).\r\n\r\n### Installation:\r\n```bash\r\n# Git way of installation:\r\ngit clone https://github.com/0x1p2/rpg-c\r\ncd rpg-c/\r\nmake\r\n./rpg-c\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\n#TAR installation.\r\ntar zvxf 0x1p2-rpg-c*.tar.gz\r\ncd 0x1p2-rpg*/\r\nmake\r\n./rpg-c\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Game Environment:\r\nIt's heavily influenced by Ultima Online. The **Stats**, **Skills**, and **Items** laid an excellent foundation for something that was obtainable but also a challenge. \r\n\r\n#### Features:\r\n+ Single-Player (for now)\r\n+ Combat\r\n+ Modular\r\n+ Linux Compatible (Windows support planned)\r\n+ Locations to be explored!\r\n+ Stat Gain\r\n\r\n#### Extra Features:\r\n|Items|Skills|Stats|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|Bandages|Archery|Dexterity|\r\n|Gold|Magery|Wisdom|\r\n||Fencing|Strength|\r\n||Swordsmanship|Luck|\r\n||Mace Fighting||\r\n|__MAX__ =>|120.0|255|\r\n\r\n#### Future Plans:\r\n+ Windows Support\r\n+ Multi-player (client/server)\r\n+ More Skills \r\n  + Evaluating Intelligence\r\n  + Focus\r\n  + Meditation\r\n  + Anatomy\r\n  + Healing (Bandage effectiveness)\r\n+ More Stats\r\n  + Stamina Bar\r\n  + Mana Bar\r\n+ More items\r\n  + Arrows\r\n  + Reagents (Magery)\r\n  + Potions\r\n   ","google":"UA-69942107-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
